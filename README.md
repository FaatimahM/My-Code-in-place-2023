# My-Code-in-place-2023

Code in Place is an introduction to programming course that covers the material from the first half of Stanford's CS106A Programming Methodologies. The class emphasizes the fundamentals of programming including: control flow, loops and conditionals, console programs with variables, graphics, lists and dictionaries. The course is taught in the Python programming language.

I participated in Code in Place between April and June 2023, and this repository hosts the projects that were taught in the course, along with my approach to the coding challenges presented.
